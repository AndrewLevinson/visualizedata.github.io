As a prospective Masters of Science candidate in the Data Visualization program at Parsons School of Design, I've learned how to design and build data visualizations to engage an audience and communicate effectively with data. I've hunted down, cleaned, and aggregated raw data sets with JavaScript and Python. I've designed visualizations, interfaces, and interactions using Sketch and Adobe Illustrator. I've generated webpage prototypes implementing front-end web development technologies of HTML/CSS and JavaScript libraries like d3, p5, and jQuery. But most importantly, I've renewed my excitement and passion in making data visual, beautiful, and intuitive to tell stories and help make complex decisions with data through web development and design.",
