While medalists earn a significant premium over fourth place finishers, the margins of victory have become vanishingly small. This series of interactive visualizations examines three stories from those margins. First, situated in the 2018 Winter Olympic Games, viewers are invited to test hypothetical scenarios in which athletes' performances improve by thin margins. The second visualization highlights a story from the swimming pool, where technological advances in equipment effectively changed the parameters of a sport. Finally, viewers can re-live the 2018 Winter Olympic Games men's singles luge event via an animation that displays the top eight athletes side-by-side on the track.",

She posted, \"if you've been sexually harassed or assaulted, write 'me too' as a reply to this tweet (@Alyssa_Milano).\" What followed was a flood of stories, building a community of support, natively and primarily through social media.The movement encouraged more women to come forward not only validating the experience of victims, but exposing more perpetrators beyond Weinstein.But is that all that was said within# metoo? How can we leverage this public platform to take the pulse of the crowd? This project explores the text of tweets in the 6 months following the start of the hashtag, using unsupervised machine learning to derive organic themes.By analyzing the scope of language used in #metoo tweets through k - means cluster analysis, we can uncover hidden themes.The project aims to answer the question: \"What are people really saying with #metoo?\"",

The number are surpassing even post-World War II records, when the world was struggling to come to terms with the most devastating event in history. United Nations defines a refugee as an individual who has been forced to leave their country due to political or religious reasons, or due to threat of war and violence. Among all the forcibly displaced people around the world, one third of them are categorized as refugees, over half of whom are under the age of 18. In a world where nearly 20 people are forcibly displaced every minute as a result of armed conflict or persecution, this study aims to visualize a distinct cause-effect view, visualizing how wars and armed conflicts lead to the insurmountable displacement, and how seasonality plays an important role in attempting the deadly journey away from home to find asylum.",

Moreover, documented by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, bacteria contamination in food have led to several food borne illness outbreaks. Using data documented by Food and Drug Administration, this research project delves deeper into food safety issues, closely analyzing food recall cases that are associated with bacteria contamination in finding patterns of distributions of questionable food sources as well as disposing \"big names\" for producing and selling these foods.",

    "desc": "The Los Angeles Riots of 1992 has a personal story to me that I only realized after doing research many years later. In order to follow through the events that took place while I was quarantined at home in the midst of the chaos, I created this visualization that had an hour-by-hour record of the events that happened from the beginning of the violence to the end of the violence. The only consequence I personally faced was not being able to get the Flamin' Hot Lays I got at my neighborhood market, Jay's Market, but instead had to go to my dad's friend's liquor store. Little did I know that the liquor store stood because my dad among other Koreans living in Los Angeles, acquired rifles and stood guard on the rooftop to deter looters. The lives that were lost in the riots were senseless. The Los Angeles Times gathered data including stories of who each person was and how they lost their lives. A memorial is usually created with the names of the honorable who died defending our country or in a tragic event that marks history. I created this visualization in order to memorialize the events, as well as the names of those who died as a means of symbolizing an ongoing tension of power relationships and race relations that still go unresolved. The sense of injustice is what ingnited the city, while little was done to absolve or resolve any of it. It's easy to forget this event when everything is seemingly normal today, but there still lies a growing tension that should not be ignored. With that, this memorial hopes to remind us that we had to go through this tragedy and that we should do a lot more to assure the prevention of another riot like this.",

As China dredges up \u22483,200 acres of territory ex nihilo in the South China Sea and emplaces sea missiles astride the Philippine archipelago, and as Russia disperses its submarines more widely across the Mediterranean as it conducts simulated attack strafing runs against NATO vessels in the Baltic Sea, the Obama and Trump national security teams have faced increasingly intricate naval diplomacy and maritime security challenges in recent years. With these shifts in mind, this thesis examines the overall patterns in U.S. naval diplomacy worldwide from 2012 to 2018, querying diplomatic tension in the STRATFOR dataset under both the Obama and Trump administrations and comparing them to vessel movements as well as freedom of navigation operations (FONOPS). In addition, this thesis examines the geostrategic impact of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton \u2019s diplomatic pivot to Asia in 2011 and Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta \u2019s decision in 2012 to move 60% of the U.S. fleet to the Pacific, breaking with decades of a roughly even 50%-50% Atlantic-Pacific force posture.",

Taking the city's existing infrastructural landscape as the starting point, this thesis moves to identify underutilized spaces where green roofs would be most amenable and beneficial from the perspective of (1) stormwater retention, (2) surface temperature regulation, and (3) biodiversity enhancement. Users will then be given opportunities to explore the data themselves and engage with questions regarding the aggregative effects, benefits, and costs of such interventions. Ultimately the goal of this project is to provide creative ways of interacting with the New York City 'building-scape' in order to foster community engagement and informed decision making for residents and policy-makers alike.",
